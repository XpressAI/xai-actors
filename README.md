# xai-actors

A [Xircuits](https://github.com/XpressAI/xircuits) component library that wraps [Thespian](https://github.com/thespianpy/Thespian) so that you can have different actors in your Xircuits diagram that have message queues.

Can enable very interesting use-cases for chatbots and [GPT agents](https://github.com/XpressAI/xai-gpt-agent-toolkit)
